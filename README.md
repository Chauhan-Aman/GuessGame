GuessGame is an interactive mobile game where the device tries to guess the number you've chosen based on the hints you provide. After entering a number, the device makes a guess. If it's incorrect, you'll guide it by indicating whether the correct number is higher or lower. The device continues refining its guesses until it matches the number you entered, making for a fun and engaging challenge.

#### Key features include:

- Enter a number and let the device attempt to guess it.

- Provide hints after each guess (higher or lower) to help the device narrow down its guesses.

- Simple, intuitive gameplay that keeps users engaged.
